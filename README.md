# gestures

fluidMotions - try all the gestures I've already made and check out the gesture assignment function on line 2356

allTogetherNAO - my latest GUI for making/testing gestures.  Not a good tool for saving them (yet)

simpleGestureSelection - reads in your NAOdialogEx2.txt file and looks for key words/phrases/punctuation.  
                         50% chance you get a gesture, %50 chance you don't.  If you get a gesture more than 4 times,
                         probability goes down.
